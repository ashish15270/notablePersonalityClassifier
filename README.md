Greetings!!
This project aims at serving an end to end tool for face recogition(without using Python's face recognition library or AI). In this model I have built a machine learning model. 
I have used images of 5 notable personalities to train the model. 
This model gives an accuracy of 85 to 90%.

Classification is restricted to only 5 people,

Dr. Abdul Kalam
Harnaaz Sandhu
Neeraj Chopra
Sunil chhetri
Virat Kohli
